# 🎨 Computer Graphics Project — C++ Assignment

## 📖 Description
This repository contains a Computer Graphics assignment implemented in C++.  
The project demonstrates fundamental graphics algorithms and drawing techniques using a graphics library such as graphics.h (BGI).

It is built to practice low-level rendering logic and understand how graphical primitives are drawn programmatically.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn core computer graphics concepts
- Implement graphics algorithms in C++
- Practice coordinate and pixel plotting
- Understand clipping and drawing techniques

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C++
- graphics.h / BGI Graphics Library
- Turbo C++ or compatible graphics environment
